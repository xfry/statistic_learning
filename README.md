# Statistic Learning

This repository is created with the purpose of saving the new statistical learning that I'm having. Feel fre to download it and make use of the code.
You will see that actually there will be examples for two knowledge fiedls:
- Biological Signal Processing
- Machine Learning

Some times I will be publishing `Jupyter Notebooks` and other times just python scripts

### Python Setup
I'm creating the `Jupyter Notebooks` using `Visual Code`. Because of that, you should download Jupyter Notebook plugins (The one made from microsoft) before downloading this repository. After that you should install all the python's libraries listed bellow or find each one of them in the `requirements.txt` file, in the root of project directory.
